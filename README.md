This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To run in development mode:

1. Copy `.env` to `.env.development.local` and add set your API key.

2. run
```bash
npm run dev
```

So you can translate the texts in the app.

To run the production server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

So you can see, the page is rendered on server with translated texts.
